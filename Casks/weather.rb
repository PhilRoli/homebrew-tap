    <<~EOS
      Weather is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). On first launch, right-click
      the app in Finder and choose "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper, or run:
        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Weather.app
      Allow Weather to use your location when macOS asks (only for automatic location).
